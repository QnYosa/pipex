may use open function to create the outfile.

utiliser le dernier argv pour le nom. 
int file = open("nameofhtefile", O_WRONLY, | O_CREAT, 0777)
if (file == -1)
	return (0); 
	=> file will seem to be the pid.

use open to check if infile is correct else return.
use open to then know if outfile exists and if wether we have to create it or not.

fd		  file
0		= stdin
1		= stdout
2		= stderr
3		= example.txt

if I do:	file2 = dup2(file, 1); I can also use a constant like file2 = dup2(file, STDOUT_FILENO)
	=> I would then have:

fd		  file
0		= stdin
1		= example.txt
2		= stderr
3		= example.txt

it doesnt change the process id nor change the fd already opened.
I can now close the useless file descriptor there 3 like this: close(3).
